# Vehicle Animations in C

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate moving vehicle animations using the `graphics.h` library. The animations include:

1. A car moving across the screen on a road.
2. A truck moving along a road with detailed graphical elements like exhaust pipes, headlights, and tires.

## üöó Features

- **Car Animation**: A simple car moves across the screen, showcasing dynamic movement and graphical rendering.
- **Truck Animation**: A detailed truck moves across the road, featuring realistic components like exhaust pipes, headlights, and a cabin.

---

## üíª Requirements

- Turbo C++ or an equivalent compiler that supports `graphics.h`.
- Ensure the graphics driver path is correctly set (e.g., `C:/TURBOC3/BGI`).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Programs

1. Download and install Turbo C++ or another compiler that supports `graphics.h`.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Vehicle-Animations-C.git
   cd Vehicle-Animations-C
   ```
````

3. Open the `.c` file for the animation you want to run in your compiler:
   - `car_animation.c` for the car animation.
   - `truck_animation.c` for the truck animation.
4. Ensure the graphics driver path is correctly configured:
   ```c
   initgraph(&gd, &gm, "C:/TURBOC3/BGI");
   ```
5. Compile and run the program.
